I thought that this course was particularly relevant to this discussion.  Also, the positive psychology approach is very interesting to me.",2,3,NA,2,2,NA,"As I indicated previously, I blitzed through the course, so it is really not that possible to evaluate its effect on my life.  Also, it is an exceptionally unusual time for me, because I was very committed to Hillary winning the presidential election, and I am devastated that Trump is President-Elect.  This overriding external fact casts a dark shadow over my life right now.  I am answering this survey the best I can under these circumstances.",4,4,5,5,3,4,4,3,4,5,1,1,"I have one ""bee in my bonnet"".  Whereas I think that mindfulness has its place, I think the near-universal acclaim for this technique in your course to be very overstated.  Therefore I designate one particular post by either blairmacdonaldbsm or annetflugard (sorry, I couldn't tell which one was the responder) to be the standout.  The original question was posted by AlexG0401 in the Discussion section after Week 6 Mindfulness;  ""Could deliberate mind wandering make you happier?""  The response provided the only source from your course which casts any doubt about the universal benefit of mindfulness.

I was a supervisor in a biotech company maybe 20 years ago, and there was a very repetitive task that had to be carried out for an extended time.  If you think that mindfulness, being in the present, was appropriate for carrying out this task, all I can tell you is that I disagree firmly.  My employees were specially allowed to listen to the radio while carrying out this task, and in my view, it would have been dehumanizing to ""be in the present"" while carrying out this task.  It took 2 hours to complete the task, and really, it could be carried out on auto-pilot, though the task was very important to complete properly.  No, mindfulness is NOT the answer for all situations.  If you want to discuss through email, mine is dmrothstein@gmail.com, in case the surveys do not contain contact information.  I would be happy to elaborate further on this subject if you care to take me up on it.","I was blitzing through the course, taking it within a 2 week period, so I couldn't spend much time on the Discussions, unfortunately.",5,4,5,5,3,4,4,4,"I thought your take on positive psychology was very important in general, and well worth considering.

I wonder whether you were pushing for reconciliation and forgiveness a little too strongly, in a world where there are plenty of bosses who are mean and massochistic, and where people (especially young women) find themselves in punishing relationships with punitive partners.  When these unfortunate victims of abuse find the courage to leave, they shouldn't even consider reconciliation at that point, in my opinion.  I don't think the presentation was sufficiently balanced in that way, i.e. I think the course promoted positive psychological approaches perhaps to the detriment of the safety of troubled individuals in abusive relationships.

I have already stated my views, above, on overstating mindfulness as a ubiquitous valuable technique, though mindfulness certainly is often an interesting approach.  
Please feel free to email if more elaboration on these points would be of value;  dmrothstein@gmail.com",4,3,1,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,6,4,NA,3,4,3,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,,,,,,,,,,,,4,4,"The concepts, utility, and techniques of positive psychology were clearly explained.  Also, the teachers and practitioners of the approach were genuine proponents and very persuasive.  The dedication and effort in communicating the material was obvious;  very nice job!",Yes,1,"Good job.  I especially liked the fact that a written transcript was presented side by side, so that I could take good notes on the video material.","As stated previously, I think the communication of the general principles of positive psychology was excellent.  I don't think sufficient care was provided to provide a counterpoint.  I don't believe that mindfulness is appropriate and applicable to all activities, and inadvertently, mindfulness can be dehumanizing in certain specific instances.  I wonder if reconciliation was promoted too strongly for situations of abusive relationships, to the inadvertent detriment of some people in specific situations.  Finally, I took the course in the shadow of political catastrophe, the election of Trump to the presidency.  Certainly some of the techniques of positive psychology are comforting to the individual, but I wonder if some of these techniques may not be appropriate in being firm in fighting against the prejudice and intolerance of the coming administration.

I am a slow reader too, but I let the computer read to me, often at the end of the day when I was exhausted and fell asleep, it was good betime stories. I have a memory impairment so I am taking the course for the third time, but this time kind of does not count. I passed it once, but I figured that if a person only takes in 20% on average, then I may as well take it at least 5 times. I will sign up in January for the self paced. I started on week one at week 7 or 8 and made it through week 2 this time. When I took the course the first two times I was in a very challenging place, a break-up, a huge loss of income (not that related to the break- up but partly caused by it) and a bunch of things falling apart. However, I found good in everything and felt blessed (grateful) from the experiences, and found writing three good things to be a life saver, I did it for several month. Many days my three good things would be, I woke up. I am breathing. I have a roof. Many do not get any of those, (I mean without two, you are dead, and it happens often). The second time, I managed to pull of a B grade, and maybe I will be able to make an A.  And I think I can pay for a certificate now. Before that was difficult. Someone was going to pay it for me though, but I never got my ID in, so it didn't happen. That's OK. I want to take it again. It took me basicially two courses to get through one. Now I am doing that again. It can only help me. I reccommend it to friends but no one takes an interest, but I tell them about three good things. I do not even mind my disabilities. I have learned that I can do well academically if I have help.  That was good to know. ",9,"When I looked at it it was longer, and I can answer the second question because it is not my first time taking it.",4,"When I get depressed, I consider it a gift because then I know I need to change something. Something as simple as three good things was able to shift my energy. I enjoyed the part of sending love to strangers, but then again that may have been from someplace else. Hahaha! I took a whole bunch of stuff the first time through.",4,3,3,3,2,2,"Well, I am a hyper feeler with plenty of empathy and compassion. Self compassion is new though. I started to take therapy for behavior. I have serious defenses that pretty much mess up my human interactions. Especially of family where I have been what is called ""identified patient"" in psychiatric terms, and that has been hard. So pretty much I do not get along with my family, which is too bad, but knowing this and setting more boundaries helps me to feel better. How did this course help? Self compassion. Considering that I may need to work on getting on with others. People do not feel very safe for me, historically, I have been happy with animals and babies love me. I am very easily hurt. I have been working for years to practice what I call ""Duck Wisdom"" to let things roll off your back (they have wexing glands to roll water off their feathers). I am even now stepping away from who has been my best and closest friend as self protection as I have seen he is fine with doing things which hurt me. I observed that he is avoidantly attached, me, insecurely attached. Plus we both have overtones of the others main style of attachment. So I saw his kindness, peppered with what is cruelty to me (although may not be to others) is like an addiction, so I am stepping away. I found many others stepping in, to fill the empty space- although I do not feel he does what he does maliciously, I also do not believe he wants to help himself and I can not change another. I guess you mentioned attachment theories in the class. Maybe that was someplace else. I do not want to be like a person pulling a handle at a slot machine for what is good in the friendship, and also getting dumped with the bad. I saw my face age 20 years in one day- I knew I had to put up boundaries. I hope I can keep it up. Human addiction to others is powerful stuff. I do not think you discuss that in the class. Oh well.

In the first two weeks I got a really clear and helpful reminder of the key learning; but by week three I felt the course was making me
less happy as it was making me very introspective, and I felt instead I needed to 'get back out there' into life and put the key learnings from the course into action, rather than thinking too much about whether or not I was happy. This worked! So for me there's something there about needing a reminder to put things into practice, particularly as I had 'gone off track' with some core elements (e.g. Gratitude) and had had a difficult time recently. So a question for the team - how to sustain the learning and practices e.g. two years down the line?! And Thank You again for making this wonderful course available.

Also, wondered why mindfulness didn't resonate with me as much, and loved the last week where the ""fit"" was discussed.  I also think a bit of it might be that mindfulness and meditation are more difficult for me.  I really believe there is a great benefit from it, so I am going to do more work in this area.  Since it's more difficult for me, I'll probably look for some guided meditations to hopefully get a jump start.

I am able to watch others in a more detached manner.  When others may be disagreeable, I am able to step back, and feel compassion for them, instead of getting personally agitated, which I really am thankful for.

I also really benefited from the discussion on forgiveness.  I struggle with a relationship with my sister, and have actively been trying to forgive her, but have trouble because she continues to trespass.  It was helpful to understand that forgiving doesn't mean that we're condoning behavior.  I may do a little more indepth work on this too!",4,4,2,3,3,NA,"See above.

","(1) Transcripts need copy editing. It seems like all of them have ""word substitutions"" that change the meanings of sentences, or turn them into nonsense. Beware the Jabberwock. I would downloaded the transcripts so I could take a highlighter to them, so I was quite aware that they needed help.

(2) Fix mistake in Week 6 Summary, Shapiro's section. There's a sentence: "". According to set point theory,our attitude and behaviors have a bigger effect on our happiness than our external circumstances – and that’s good news for mindfulness.""  Neuroplasticity is the good news, yes? She was happy to have set point theory take a hit.

(3) Facilitate people getting together in person...or even virtually. I really wanted to meet others taking the course. I was disappointed that I couldn't find the main Facebook Group for GG101x. When I clicked the syllabus-link and the web-link, I got this message: ""Sorry, this content isn't available right now
The link you followed may have expired, or the page may only be visible to an audience you're not in.""   Searching on fb for GG101x, I did find 7 closed groups: 4 were based in countries other than US; 1 was LBGTA+ (I'm straight), and 2 were very small (16 members and 10 members). Today I figured out that a ""closed"" group may still take members, so I made requests to the 2 small local ones.

The videos are usually short enough so you can watch them without having to spend too much time -very nice for watching when commuting !

I also think it would be great if the ""Theater"" posts were able to link us to full movies, because they may be hard to locate for those of us that don't have access to streaming services, but I do understand the constraints there.",11350,lmsalgado@mail.usf.edu,lmsalgado,0.93,0.4666666667,0.5166666667,0.7166666667,0.8833333333,0.7333333333,0.8666666667,0.85,0.9333333333,0.9666666667,0.95,0,1,1,0.6666666667,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0.29375,0.9666666667,0.875,audit,N/A,Y,N,N/A,3.75,4.625,1.25,3

I find the discussion groups very clumsy to use and not encouraging to discussion per se.  Because it is impossible to isolate your own posts or get feedback when someone comments on one of your posts, it doesn't really promote discussion.  Also because the oldest posts are at the top, people who post later do not get as much feedback.  If the most recent posts were at the top, then I think it would even out the feedback - as people added their own posts, they would look back on the most recent 10 or 20 posts (and further if intensely interested).","After the Happiness Practice, include in the surveys a comments section where people can explain a bit more about why they did or didn't do the practice.

When I told her about the course she replied that she would like to take it too. I told her that she could teach the course in many ways. She was a woman who lived a relatively happy and fulfilled life. We talked about some of the materials and I think that it helped her find more gratitude for her life and appreciation of her family that loved her dearly. She passed in week 8 of the course and I could not get back to it in time to complete it. Still I learned new tools to promote happiness and feel that it helped me though this transition. ,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,NA,,,4776,kpeifer1@gmail.com,WEBreath,0.39,0.6333333333,Not Attempted,Not Attempted,Not Attempted,Not Attempted,Not Attempted,Not Attempted,Not Attempted,Not Attempted,Not Attempted,0,1,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,Not Attempted,1,1,1,1,1,Not Attempted,Not Attempted,Not Attempted,Not Attempted,Not Attempted,Not Attempted,Not Attempted,0.1375,0.8333333333,NA,verified,ID Verified,N,N,N/A,5.75,6.5,2.75,1.75

We are creating a new medical school where we are very interested and focused on our students as human beings and helping them grow and thrive in this environment rather than experience what so many have encountered previously. The intentionality of the creation of this school led to the position I am in as Director of Wellness & Integrative Medicine. 

The speakers and readings from this class were each excellent and informative as I create this curriculum. I plan on including some of this material where possible for our students. I love how Dacher & Emiliana focused their lives and research on the positive aspects rather than the deficits we so often see. This class opened my eyes in so many ways. The exercises were particularly challenging. In the forgiveness exercise, I felt old wounds re-open. Through the context of self-discovery from this course and where I am in my life today, it was really interesting to experience all of those old emotions while viewing them through a new lens. I often would talk with my husband about the course and what we were doing and it was extremely valuable for our marriage as well. 

Last week, I had the pleasure of meeting with and talking to Dr. Stuart Brown and his science of play. I mentioned to him that I was enrolled in your course and he had the kindest of words about you and your work.

I started to better understand myself and my own problems, such as perfectionism and complete lack of self compassion and have slowly applied different thinking towards myself and my high/unrealistic expectations (and it's improved my mood and well-being substantially!) 

This course has made me be much more pro-active towards improving my happiness, I began therapy treatment once a week and I joined an MBSR class and yoga course - the fact that I did this on my own is very significant (in the past I would rely on a doctor's orders or a family member's strong recommendation.) 

The forgiveness practice has been incredibly helpful in teaching me how to slowly begin the process towards people who have repeatedly hurt me - so far it has been a huge weight off my shoulders, thank you <3 <3 <3 

Taking this course also gave me tons of inspiration to create personal materials for me to be more accountable towards continuous happiness practices. I haven't allowed myself to create anything in a very long time (fear of failure issues) and I'm so excited about this! Again, thank you :)",5,5,4,4,4,4,"I take deep breaths at work when confronted with issues that would normally annoy me (they still annoy me, but I'm not so quick with a negative response or remark) - it also makes me more open to people's suggestions even when I think I have the perfect solution to a problem. I believe my personal attitude towards work has relaxed substantially and coincidentally I have gotten more freelance work offers than I really need. 

My self compassion has improved dramatically - I hurt my back and gave myself plenty of time to recover. This is a drastic difference in comparison to my old self who would ""tough it out"" and have enormous amounts of anxiety for missing work. I'm also becoming more and more aware of my constant need for perfectionism and instead of beating myself over the head about it, I'm approaching this with curiosity and compassion - allowing the thoughts to move through while being aware of them and non- judgmental... it's been interesting getting to know me this way.

I've been better able to talk to my husband about things that have made me angry in a constructive and solution seeking ways. Our relationship is now more filled with communication and less so with passive aggressive behavior. I'm more willing to work at it and my husband is responding in mirroring ways.

I'm interested in pursuing more academic courses in psychology and possibly pursue a career change in counseling or art therapy. It's exciting to be excited about school and possible new beginnings in my life.

I replied a couple of times to other people's comments and noticed TA's comments but there was nothing really interesting for me to want to go back and see if someone replied to what I had to say. The only time that discussion felt useful was for submitting questions to the live Q&A sessions. I think if there was some sort of ""notification"" feedback that someone commented on my comment or someone also replied to a comment I replied on, it would have made me be more aware of an ongoing conversation and more motivating for me to return to it (like facebook notifications do).

Several I now do on a regular basis.  Generally I feels much happier and fulfilled in my life.  I feel like I have more purpose in the direction I am taking.  I am in the middle of a career change which can alter all of this, but I do feel like it has accelerated the positive feelings that have gone along with this major shift in my life instead of focusing on the negative aspects.  In September I got behind because my daughter in law had a new child and I went back east to help with the family.  When I returned I had some other things come up with job interviews and things.  But I felt like this was so important that I forced myself to catch up at the same time taking time to purposefully practice the various parts of the program.  It really has helped me, my kids and friends have noticed a change.  I have a couple of job offers and life is good.  Three years ago my former husband left with the 12 year younger neighbor after 32 years of marriage.  I finally feel like life is good and I am better off and I attribute a large boost towards that from the class in the last few months.

But the course strengthened my resolve to start being more mindful again), I tried to be more grateful and tried to ""see"" more things in my daily life to be grateful for, I tried to forgive two people who have hurt me in the past (meaning: stop holding a grudge against them, sending them good thoughts (""may you live with ease, may you be happy, may you be free from pain""))

Kudos Emiliana and Dacher!",Yes,1,"Nothing, really. Everything (like navigation, for example) is very intuitive, in my opinion","The questions in the problemsets and exams: I get that you don't want to make it too difficult, because scoring low would make people feel bad and probably discourage them from continuing the course and engaging with the contents in general. And you are right, it definitely shouldn't be too difficult. However, many of the questions (or, well, not the questions, but the answers you can choose from) are so glaringly obvious that I often only skimmed through the questions and answer options without really thinking about the topics. I experienced the questions often like this: ""What effect does positive practice xy have according to expert z?"" Answer options: three with a negative effect and one with a positive effect --> so, of course, it is the only one with the positive effect. It was the same with the checkbox questions: in most cases you could just choose either all the positive outcomes or all the negative outcomes, depending on what the question asked for.
Without wanting to be too arrogant, but I think, that even without doing any of the course work, I could have easily had a score of 80%+. Which made the questions kind of moot, in my opinion (at least for myself).

Often in the course, there are videos and then text or an article to read below it. A couple of times I had the feeling, that the text below the video more or less only repeated what was said in the video. That kind of repeating the same information several times in direct succession bored me immensely (however, I'm a person who might have ADD and is generally low on attention and easily distracted, so i might not be representative).

My two thoughts for potential for improvement are:

1) See if there is any good way to make the course slightly shorter. It was  lot to get through. Sometimes but not often the same points were repeated.

2) A little more attention could be given on how to integrate the coursework into your life. That could be an opportunity for research and experimentation in order to figure out the best way to do that.

2) See if there is anyway to trim the course a little bit.

3) Find someway to make the course more interactive. 

Perhaps have video Skype sessions that students participate in. Maybe have some kind of team project. I'm not sure how to practically achieve this goal but it's worthwhile if you can figure it out.

4) I'd make the midterm and exam more difficult or have the option for greater difficulty. I get that evaluation isn't the purpose of the course and the last thing that you'd like to do is to make a course on happiness stress inducing. However, greater challenge is more motivating to really learn the material for some weirdos like me.

Part of my reason for halting was a sudden spike in workload and then changes in my personal circumstances that felt life threatening to me. I think you mention somewhere in the course that if you feel under threat, you forget the finer points of living well. This has been the case for me. I stopped because the life you live in a poor country distracts you from who you are, not because the work you guys did was crap.
I still think the course has immense emotional value and especially when the threat has passed will help me get back to a more even keel.
